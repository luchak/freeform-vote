        This page demonstrates using{" "}
        <a href="https://trueskill.org/">TrueSkill</a> to construct a voting
        system where not every voter has to evaluate every entry. Each voter
        instead ranks every entry they have an opinion about. We can get scores
        (and therefore a consensus ranking) from these inputs by treating each
        voter's ranking as the result of a free-for-all match between all the
        entries they ranked, and use TrueSkill to update entry ratings based on
        the results of each match.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Votes:</b> each block of lines below is an individual voter's
        ranking. Entries that come first are ranked higher, entries appearing on
        the same line are ties. For example: in the default rankings in the box
        below, the first user has ranked Asiago and Brie tied for first, with
        Cheddar coming in second. The second user ranked Brie and Cheddar first,
        and Asiago second.
